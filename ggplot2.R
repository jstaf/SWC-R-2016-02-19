# ggplot2 is a plotting framework that is (relatively) easy to use, powerful,

#Okay, let's start. ggplot2 revolves around a certain kind of variable: the
#ggplot2 object.

# What is a ggplot2 object? Basically it is your data + information on how to
# interpret it + the actual geometry it uses to plot it.

# How to create ggplot2 objects:

# You can add as much data in the inital function call as you want. All of these
# work, but the final version is the only "complete" object that fully specifies
# the data used for the plot. 
ref <- ggplot()
ref <- ggplot(data)
ref <- ggplot(data, aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total)) 
# This is the same thing as the line above:
colnames(data)
ref <- ggplot(data, aes(x = data$bodywt, y = data$sleep_total))

# To store an object (to add to it later/plot it on demand), just give it a
# reference. Simply typing the reference will display the plot (if you've
# provided enough information to make it.)
ref
# As you can see, we haven't specified everything we need yet.

# IMPORTANT: There are 3 components to making a plot with a ggplot object: your
# data, the aesthetic mappings of your data, and the geometry. If you are
# missing one, you won't get a functional plot.

# Your data should be a dataframe with everything you want to plot. Note that it
# is possible to put data from multiple sources (ie. different dataframes) in 
# the same plot, but it's easier if everything is in the same 2-dimensional
# dataframe.
ref <- ggplot(data)

# The aesthetic mappings tell ggplot2 how to interpret your data. Which values
# in your dataframe are the y-values, x-values, what should be used for colors, etc.
ref <- ggplot(data, aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total))
ref

# The geometry is the actual stuff that goes on the plot. You can specify any 
# geometry as long as you have supplied the values it needs. If you've specified
# the required aesthetic mappings (which data corresponds to x, y, etc.), all
# you need to do is tell ggplot2 to create a certain geometry- for instance a
# scatterplot.

# Just add the geometry you want to your object. In this case, we are making a scatterplot.
ref <- ggplot(data, aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total)) + geom_point()
ref <- ggplot(data) + geom_point(aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total))
ref

# All you need to do to add more information to your plot/change things is add
# on more elements. Lets add a logarithmic scale on the x axis.
ref <- ggplot(data, aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()
ref

# Lets add a smoothed mean.
ref + geom_smooth()

# You can also specify aesthetics inside the call to create geomtery. 
ref <- ggplot(data) + geom_point(aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total)) + scale_x_log10()
ref
ref <- ref + geom_smooth()
ref
# Why didn't that work? This is because when we specfy aesthetics inside a call 
# to geomtery it only applies for that layer (only geom_point got the x and y
# values). The only information that gets passed to all geometery calls is
# aethetics specified in the initial creation of the ggplot object.

# So if we wanted that to work, we'd have to do this:
ggplot(data) + scale_x_log10() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total))

# It's important to note that geometry will automatically use any aesthetic
# mappings that it understands, and ignore ones it doesn't. So if you specify as
# much stuff as you can in the inital call that can be used, it'll save you
# work.

# Like this:
ggplot(data, aes(x = bodywt, y = sleep_total)) + scale_x_log10() + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

# To save a file use ggsave(). Defaults to last plot made but you can specify a

# Here's a few frustrating errors I've run into from time to time (note that I'm
# paraphrasing here... it might not match the exact text...)

# Error: ggplot does not know how to interpret class numeric (or matrix, etc.)
# Solution: Make ALL of your data into dataframes. ggplot2 hates everything else.

# Error: Aesthetics must be length one or the same length as the data. 
# Solution: Make sure all of the aesthetic mappings your are feeding to ggplot2 
# are the same length. If it seems like they are, you might be passing the wrong
# aethetics to different geometries (especially if they use different data).
# Sometimes an aesthetic from the initial function call gets passed along when
# it shouldn't and you need to set it to NA.

# Error: No layers in plot.
# Solution: Add some geometry.
