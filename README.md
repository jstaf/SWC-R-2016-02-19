The R materials taught at Queen's University on Feb 19 2016

These are the files used to teach various topics. In order:

Morning session:
+ for introductory R materials, see https://github.com/ColauttiLab/RCrashCourse/blob/master/1_fundamentals.Rmd 
+ `gapminder.R` - working through the gapminder dataset to learn about handling large datasets
+ `ggplot2.R` - a heavily-commented tutorial script to teach the basics of plotting with `ggplot2` 
+ `stats.R` - learning how to do t-tests and ANOVA statistics. Other statistical tests are done in a very similar way to these two.

Afternoon session:
+ https://github.com/kazi11/biomaRt_tutorial - There is a link to a webcast at the bottom of the page. Check it out for a free tutorial on how to use `biomaRt` for data mining.
+ `RMarkdownExamples.Rmd` - This is an example document we wrote that covers how to create pretty looking reports in R Markdown
