To render this document as HTML, make sure you have the `knitr` and `RMarkdown` packages installed, then open this file in RStudio and hit the `knit` button over the "Source" window. 

This is some normal text!!!

This is normal text, *this is italic text*, **this is bold text**. ***what does this do***

To include code inline with your text `kdjflaskdjfl`. 

This is how code looks on multiple lines: 

```
Code line 1
Code line 2
etc....
```

We're done with our code!

## including code that actually runs

Here's how you do it:

```{r}
5 + 3
print('hello')
a <- 4
```

Add some plots:
```{r this is our name}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = 1:10, y = 1:10))
```

## lists

This how you a list:

+ item 1
+ item 2
+ item 3

Numbered list:

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 4
    + sublist? maybe?
    + another element

## having code run when you want it to

This code never gets run
```{r eval=FALSE}
print('this should not run')
```

Our template code doesn't get rendered, but the output does:
```{r echo=FALSE}
print('only our output should appear')
```

code chunks know about code you've run previously
```{r}
dependency <- 'present'
```

this code chunk depends on the last one
```{r}
print(dependency)
```

Have code silently run, but make no output:
```{r include=FALSE}
silent <- 5678
```

but we can print it here
```{r}
print(silent)
```

We can include R code in inline text like this: `r 5 + 4`. We can also refer to variables this way: `r dependency` ldsakfj;sladkjf;sldakjf;lsaksdjfldsakjflsadkjflasdkjflsakdjflaskdjflasdkjfalsdkjfaslkdjflasdkjflasdkjflaskdjf. That was just filler text.


Demonstrating the && and || (short-circuit AND and OR operators)
```{r}
TRUE && FALSE
TRUE || FALSE
```
